=========
C# Bookmark Manager for Firefox and Chrome.
-----
This project was created to provide tools to manage bookmarks in Firefox and Chrome such as: CRUD for bookmarks, duplicate management, database cleaning and so on.

Created initially as a means to learn some basic C# and ease the transition to a Git repository, development is now suspended indefinitely as I intend to 'port' or 'translate' this project idea in Python.

Most functionality is not implemented yet, but it does currently provide with a viewer of sorts for the places.sqlite database from firefox, some summary statistics on it and a list of all duplicates.
